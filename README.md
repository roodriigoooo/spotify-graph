## spotify graph
### authors: Johanna Schmucker and Rodrigo Sastré

Originally a project for school implementing shared queues in spotify, turned
into a knowledge graph style visualization of music taste similarity with 
your friends. 

currently WIP: would like to develop the similarity mechanism, perhaps 
employing historical user's reproduction history and recent footprints to 
develop more interesting embeddings.
